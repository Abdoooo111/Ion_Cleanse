# Project Journal: Ion Cleanse

## Objective
To develop a **3D-modeled smart air filtration tower** through a combination of **computer-aided design**, **material analysis**, **airflow simulation**, and thorough **documentation**.  
This was not for any assignment or competition — just something I wanted to work on for myself, both as a technical exploration and as a kind of personal challenge. Along the way, I treated this journal more like a diary, jotting down not just technical progress but also thoughts, doubts, and small daily reflections.

- **Total Duration:** 96 hours  
- **Length:** 21 days  
- **Start Date:** 12 June 2025  
- **End Date:** 2 July 2025

## Daily Log

### Day 1 (12/6/2025) – 4 hours  
I kicked things off by brainstorming the **core functionality** of an outdoor smart filtration tower. I wanted it to feel practical — not futuristic or overly ambitious, but something that could realistically sit in a city street or a schoolyard.  
I sketched out some **basic concepts** in my notebook before moving to 3D modeling. At this stage, the design was just a tall, simple cylindrical body.  

*(I remember drinking tea while doing this and thinking: this project might actually keep me busy for a few weeks in a good way.)*

### Day 2 (13/6/2025) – 4 hours  
Today was mostly refinement. I reshaped the cylindrical geometry and made the proportions more realistic. I spent a chunk of time **reading up on urban air filtration methods**, particularly comparing HEPA vs. activated carbon systems. I realized early on that the design had to lean toward **carbon-based filters**, given how common gaseous pollutants are in Egypt.  
I also logged rough **dimensions** into my documentation.

### Day 3 (14/6/2025) – 5 hours  
Added **vent slats** and hollow chambers into the structure. This was more tedious than exciting, but it made the design look more functional.  
On the research side, I compared **pressure drop rates** for filters depending on whether the airflow was vertical or horizontal. That helped me understand how much energy the fans would eventually consume.  
Also began drafting a **Bill of Materials (BOM)**. Not final, but it gave me a clearer idea of what parts I’d theoretically need.

### Day 5 (16/6/2025) – 5 hours  
Focused on **particle behavior simulations**. Watching fine particles interact with the filters gave me ideas about how pollutants like dust and smoke would behave.  
Meanwhile, I researched **sustainable filtering materials**, particularly coconut-shell carbon and aluminum mesh. I liked the idea of the system being both high-performing and eco-friendly.  

*(At some point I got distracted looking at coconut plantations online. The internet really knows how to drag you into side rabbit holes.)*

### Day 6 (17/6/2025) – 4 hours  
Started comparing **cost and suppliers** for materials. Not that I was buying anything, but it felt important to see what would be feasible in reality. I also integrated the concept of **sensors at the air inlet**, to detect pollution levels before and after filtration.  
Ended the day by writing a short piece about what kinds of filters would be most effective for **Cairo’s specific air quality**.

### Day 11 (22/6/2025) – 5 hours  
Built the **base platform** in the model, including space for **cable routing**. It gave the tower a more grounded and realistic feel.  
Finalized **chamber segmentation**, splitting sections into modular parts.  

*(I remember thinking: this is starting to look like something I could actually imagine installed in a city square. That was a nice feeling.)*

### Day 14 (25/6/2025) – 5 hours  
This was mostly about **cost-to-efficiency analysis**. I tried to balance filtration performance with practical affordability.  
I also improved the **mesh resolution** in my airflow simulations. It slowed down the computer, but gave clearer results.

### Day 18 (29/6/2025) – 4 hours  
Spent most of the day cleaning up the **geometry** and refining small edges. It was almost meditative.  
I finalized the design file and even drafted some **pseudo-code for sensor control**, just to imagine how the logic might work in real life.

### Day 21 (2/7/2025) – 4 hours  
Packaged everything into a **final repository**: the models, the simulation results, and the written documentation.  
Archived everything neatly. A satisfying end.  

*(Honestly, I felt relieved. This project became a bigger part of my days than I expected, but it was worth it.)*
